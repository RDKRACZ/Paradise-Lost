## Advisory: 1.17 ‚ûù 1.18 World Migration

At this time, migrating worlds will work fine all elements of the mod **except** for dimension information.

Due to unforeseen issues currently beyond our control, the game is currently unable to migrate the Aether Dimension from the 1.17 format to 1.18s.

Anyone choosing to migrate worlds is **strongly encouraged** to make a backup and additionally opt to regenerate the dimension due to the worldgen changes made,
as even if this component is stabilized, **there is no chunk blending in place for world transitions**.

(The Aether Dimension can be regenerated by removing the folder `<MC_SAVES_FOLDER>/<WORLD_NAME>/dimensions/the_aether`)

Efforts are currently ongoing to determine the feasibility of getting this component working, to ensure a smoother migration to 1.18.x.
Further news regarding this effort can be found on our [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/wmMa47n).
